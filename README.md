## Abstract
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is an umbrella term for tools that run on an end userâ€™s computer, emulating tasks previously executed through a user interface by means of a software robot. Many studies have highlighted potential benefits of RPA, by bridging artificial intelligence and business process management, it provides the promise of robots as a virtual workforce that perform tasks leading to improvements in efficiency for business processes. However, most commercial tools do not cover the Analysis phase of the RPA lifecycle. The lack of automation in such a phase is mainly reflected by the absence of technological solutions to look for the best candidate processes of an organization to be automated. Based on process mining techniques, we seek to define an automatable indicator system used to guide and direct companies that seek to better prioritize their RPA activities.
